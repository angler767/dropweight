    The diagram on the right is that of a simplified dropweight stringing machine. The physics behind
    a dropweight stringing machine are simple. Tension is applied to the string when the weight bar is 
    horizontal, as the end of the hover animation would suggest. The gripper is spun in a clockwise direction 
    to adjust the tension in the string until the tension bar is at a horizontal. When the bar is at a 
    horizontal and has no acceleration, the system is at equilibrium which means the sum of torques is zero 
    and solving for the tension in the string is a simple statics question. The tension in the string multiplied 
    by the radius of the hinge has to equal the sum of moment of inertia of the bar multiplied by the acceleration 
    of gravity and the moment of inertia of the weight multiplied by the acceleration of gravity.

    Hi, I'm Dennis and I've been stringing badminton rackets for just over a year. I string with a self modded <br> Gamma Progression II 
    machine and at the time of publishing this website, I've strung over 140 rackets. <br> After starting my stringing service, I 
    was met with positive reviews on Google of my stringing which really <br> kept me going 
    <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dennis's+badminton+stringing+service/@43.6675899,-79.4285647,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b35d5936dd6cf:0x1af3cc7db8689407!8m2!3d43.6676986!4d-79.4270948" target="_blank">Reviews</a>. My machine is a 
    <em> Dropweight Machine</em>
    which means it uses torque created by <br> gravity to apply tension into the strings. Analysis of the mechanics are above.

    Stringing Tips for New Stringers (dropweight)
</h2>
    <div style = "font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">
    <ul id = "tips">
        <li>Prevent compression of frame by pushing top of post out and bottom of post in before tightening screws</li>
        <li>DO NOT STRETCH FRAME WHEN MOUNTING ONTO POSTS TENSION FROM STRINGS WILL DAMAGE THE FRAME</li>
        <li>When adjusting tension with gripper, only adjust when tension bar is vertical</li>
        <li>General rule is to string horizontals from bottom to top</li>
        <li>If hybrid stringing, thicker string used for verticals and thinner strings used for horizontals</li>
        <li>Straighten horizontals after tensioning due to fly clamps pulling them down</li>
        <li>3.5 Armlengths for verticals and 3 armlengths for horizontals is a general rule if you're new</li>
        <li>Double tension first 2 and last 2 horizontals with +2 tension</li>
